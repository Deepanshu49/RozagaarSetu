      Rozgar Setu is a scheme launched by the Madhya Pradesh government to help skilled workers who returned home due to the COVID-19 pandemic find employment. The initiative acts as a bridge between workers and employers, ensuring industries get the manpower they need while workers secure jobs.
      Under this scheme, the government identifies skilled workers who previously worked in industries and connects them with employers looking for labor. The workers are categorized based on their skills, such as construction, mining, textiles, agriculture, and government sectors. Employers can then hire workers through a common portal, making the process efficient.
      The scheme wailled workers who previously worked in industries and connects them with employers looking for labor. The workers are categorized based on their skills, such as construction, mining, textiles, agriculture, and government sectors. Employers can then hire workers through a common portal, making the process efficient.
      The scheme was introduced to address the migrant worker crisis caused by the pandemic, where millions of workers lost jobs and had to return to their home states. By providing employment opportunities, Rozgar Setu helps workers sustain themselves financially and supports industries facing labor shortages.
      Overall, the scheme benefits both workers and employers, ensuring a smooth employment process while strengthening the state's economy. It is a unique initiative that showcases how governments can support workers during crises.
